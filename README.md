# Analysis of NOAA

###  Project Overview
This project analyzes temperature data between 2005 - 2014, focusing on high-temperature trends. It includes cleaning, visualization, and exploration of the dataset. The analysis helps to identify temperature patterns, handle leap years, and present data insights interactively.

### Dataset
1. temperature.csv: Contains temperature records for various locations over several years.
2. BinSize.csv: (Optional file if used) Additional dataset for binning or summarizing data.

### Features & Tasks Performed
1. Data Cleaning
    - Filtered data for the years 2005 - 2014.
    - Detected and removed leap days (February 29) to avoid skewing trends in the data.
2.  Data Analysis & Visualization
     - Line Graph
       * Displays high temperatures from 2005 to 2014.
       * Clear visualization of temperature trends over the years.
     - Scatter Plot:
       * Scatter plot of temperatures after removing leap days.
       * Helps in identifying anomalies and distribution.
    - Legends, Labels & Chart Formatting
    - Map Visualization
    - Temperature Summary
       * Generated a concise summary report.
      

## Tools & Technologies
+ Python
+ Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
+ Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization (line charts, scatter plots).
+ Folium: For map visualizations.
+ Jupyter Notebook / Streamlit (Optional): For presenting the data analysis.
